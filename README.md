# IMPLEMENTING-A-SHELL
The Shell is the command interpreter on Linux systems.
Shell is a command interpreter, which interprets the command given by the user to the kernel. It can also be defined as an interface between a user and the operating system. 
Command shells are the most basic tools that facilitate user interaction with the operating system, and one of the oldest. Although modern operating systems with graphical user interfaces no longer require users to work at a command prompt, most OSes still provide a command shell for lower level tasks.
